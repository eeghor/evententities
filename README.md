Extract entities from live event description

## Live event descriptions
Although this package is intended to help extracting features from live event descriptions, itâ€™s simply looking for certain types of entities in a string. These can then be used to produce dictionary-based features for machine learning models. 

## Entities

* artists
	* we search through over 180,000 artists features on Spotify
* Australian suburbs
	* we use a comprehensive list of suburbs on par with that by Australia Post

	* all world countries along with their alternative names and the official 3-letter abbreviations
